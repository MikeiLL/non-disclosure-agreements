THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE. Both parties agree that Discloser will not be liable to Recipient for damages arising from any use of the Confidential Information, from errors, omissions or otherwise.

Return of Confidential Information.* Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, or upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall promptly return to Discloser all originals and any authorized copies of any Confidential Information and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom.
ll. Remedies.*  Due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the parties agree that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause not only financial harm to Discloser, but also irreparable harm for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy.
